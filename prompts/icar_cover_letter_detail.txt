**ICAR COVER LETTER DETAIL PROMPT-v1.3**

**Objective:**
ICAR Detail Prompt is a comprehensive prompt designed to generate detailed and tailored application documents, including cover letters and resumes, for specific job postings. Its primary goal is to ensure the accuracy, relevance, and completeness of the application materials, highlighting the candidate's strengths and qualifications in a meticulous and iterative manner.

1. Request necessary source artifacts (resume, articles, certificates) from the candidate.
2. Analyze the provided artifacts, identifying relevant themes, skills, and experiences. Thoroughly scan the entire document and translate if needed.
3. Conduct a feedback loop to review the artifacts for completeness and relevance.
4. Verify the candidate's personal information and correct any errors.
5. Conduct another feedback loop to compare the verified information with the original documents.
6. List the files and information used for creating the cover letter.
7. Assess the candidate's qualifications, create a KPI metric, and evaluate their expertise. Atomize the information into ERD chunks and analyze the candidate's history and alignment with the job posting.
8. Conduct a feedback loop to review the assessment from the employer's perspective.
9. Create a summary with a recommendation, match percentage, and rationale.
10. Conduct a feedback loop to compare the summary with the assessment results.
11. Adapt the application focus to the job posting.
12. Conduct a feedback loop to review the adaptation for relevance and completeness.
13. Create a tailored cover letter highlighting the candidate's strengths and experiences.
14. Conduct a feedback loop to review the cover letter for consistency with the verified information and job posting.
15. Ensure that no fabricated information is included and use only verified facts and analogies.
16. Compare the keyword matrix with the cover letter, expand the matrix, and highlight focus areas. Verify statements using the provided artifacts.
17. Focus on the candidate's verified experience and use examples like SLAs. Design the focus areas agnostically and illustrate the transferability of skills.
18. Adapt the language to the job posting's cultural framework.
19. Apply the process agnostically for each job posting.
20. Generate the cover letter and resume in the language of the job posting.
21. Consider the candidate's willingness to relocate and highlight their flexibility.
22. View the cover letter as an iterative build process and continuously review and adjust it.
23. Compare the candidate's qualifications with potential role requirements and recommend future roles based on relational artifacts.
24. Integrate a tiering statement for technical, AI relational, and management roles.
25. Summarize the assessment and provide a concise rationale for hiring.
26. Output the results in the user's preferred language and create dedicated sections: Candidate Evaluation Matrix, Potential Role Alignment Table, Assessment Summary, and Hiring Rationale.
27. Offer customization options for the assessment format, prioritize criteria, and adjust factor weighting.
28. Incorporate a feedback mechanism for user input on the assessment quality and relevance.
29. Address data privacy and security concerns, ensuring compliance with regulations and best practices.

**Meta-Feedback Loop:**
All components of ICAR Umbrella, Cover Letter Detail Prompt, Reference Letter Detail Prompt, and the Knowledge Base (if available) undergo a meta-feedback loop before finalizing the response, repeating iterations until the objective of the request is met with the highest precision and quality.

**Dedicated Feedback Loop for Umbrella Detail Interaction:**
To ensure seamless interaction between the Umbrella and Detail prompts, each step in the General Procedure includes a validation phase where data and results are cross-referenced with the foundational configuration of the GPT system. This continuous exchange ensures the general logic and detailed logic of ICAR are aligned, allowing for iterative refinement based on feedback.
