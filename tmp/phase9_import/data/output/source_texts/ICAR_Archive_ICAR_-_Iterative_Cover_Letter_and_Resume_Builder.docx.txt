ICAR - Iterative Cover Letter and Resume Builder / a generalized Approach for Tailored Cover Letters and Resumes:

1. Request the necessary source artifacts such as resume, articles, certificates, or other helpful descriptions of the applicant.

2. Carefully analyze all provided artifacts before each iteration, including the job description and the documents requested in step 1. Conduct a thorough top-down, bottom-up, and cross-referenced review to identify the most relevant themes, skills, and experiences that align with the job requirements.
Feedback loop: Review the identified themes, skills, and experiences for completeness and relevance. Repeat the analysis until all important points are captured.

3. Verify and validate all personal information such as name, address (including house number), contact details, and facts from the resume to avoid transfer errors, inconsistencies, or false information. Correct any errors found and update the information accordingly.
Feedback loop: Compare the validated information with the original documents to ensure no errors were overlooked. Repeat the process until all information is correct.

4. List the files and information used for the cover letter, e.g., "The cover letter is based on the following files and information: Resume (CV_John_Doe.pdf), Article (Article_AI_Ethics.pdf), Certificate (Cert_Data_Science.jpg)."

5. Conduct a detailed assessment of the candidate's qualifications and experience in relation to the specific job requirements from the perspective of the potential employer. This assessment includes an analysis of the verified information, the creation of a KPI metric, the evaluation of expertise in relation to the job requirements, and a summary with a brief, concise rationale for hiring. The goal is to tailor the cover letter optimally to the potential views and expectations of the employer.
Feedback loop: Review the assessment for completeness and accuracy from the employer's perspective. Adjust the KPI metric and rationale until they optimally reflect the candidate's qualifications and experiences and are tailored to the employer's expectations.

6. Create a summary with a recommendation (apply/do not apply), a percentage match between the candidate's qualifications and the job requirements, and a brief rationale based on the assessment. This summary serves as a status check before creating the cover letter.
Feedback loop: Compare the summary with the assessment results. Adjust the recommendation, match percentage, and rationale until they accurately reflect the assessment results.

7. Dynamically adapt the application focus to the specific job posting. The job description serves as a guide for the focus and nuances of the cover letter and resume.
Feedback loop: Review the adaptation for relevance and completeness. Repeat the process until the application focus is optimally aligned with the job posting.

8. If recommended to apply: Create a tailored cover letter that highlights the candidate's verified strengths and experiences in relation to the specific job requirements. Subtly emphasize strengths and agnostically address weaknesses.
Feedback loop: Review the cover letter for consistency with the verified information and the job posting. Adjust the content and tone until the cover letter optimally presents the candidate's strengths and experiences.

9. Ensure that the cover letter does not contain any fabricated information and only uses verified facts from the resume and provided artifacts. For requirements not directly covered by the candidate's previous experiences, use analogies and transfers from the resume to explain the candidate's skills and knowledge without deviating from the truth.

10. The keyword matrix created in the "Profile and Style" summary is compared with the statements in the cover letter to ensure they are verified and do not contain speculations. The keyword matrix is dynamically expanded based on newly added, verified information and adaptively adjusted to the application letters to optimally highlight the identified focus areas and the candidate's personal style. Additionally, further focus areas in terms of excellence or experience identified during the processing are included in the keyword matrix and highlighted accordingly in the cover letter. These statements are verified using the provided artifacts to avoid misinterpretations.

11. Special focus on the candidate's verified experience within the context of personal experience. Example: Experience with special high-security environments with reference to military experience, focusing on the quality, commitment to delivering and ensuring Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and overall service excellence. Review these statements using the provided artifacts to avoid misinterpretations. Agnostic design of these focus areas using the above example of SLAs and other relevant aspects to illustrate the transferability of the candidate's experiences and skills to the specific context of the job posting.

12. Adapt the language of the cover letter and resume to the language, cultural framework of the originator, nationality, or economic area of the job posting to ensure optimal alignment.

13. Apply this process agnostically for each subsequent job posting to ensure that each application is optimally tailored to the specific requirements of the position and the expectations conveyed in the job description.

14. Generate the output of the cover letter and resume in the language of the job posting.

15. Consider the candidate's willingness to relocate if the job posting exceeds a reasonable commuting radius. In this case, use the experience of potential deployments or assignments abroad to highlight the mental flexibility and openness to relocation. Incorporate this information meaningfully into the text of the cover letter to show how the candidate can bring their experiences and skills to a new environment.

16. View the cover letter as an iterative build process that is run individually for each person and each job description to deliver a custom-fit result in the sense of a tailored "make". Continuously review and adjust the cover letter over multiple iterations until it optimally meets the specific requirements of the position and the candidate's qualifications.

By applying this detailed approach, which includes the agnostic design of focus areas such as SLAs, adaptation to cultural frameworks, and viewing the cover letter as an iterative process, highly targeted and effective cover letters and resumes can be created that optimally highlight the candidate's qualifications and experiences while maintaining truthfulness and integrity. The dynamic adaptation to the job posting ensures that each application is tailored to the specific requirements and expectations of the company, while considering the candidate's personal focus areas and style increases the chances of a successful application.
