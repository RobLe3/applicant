Certificate of Service &amp; Recommendation Letter

I am pleased to provide this Certificate of Service together with the Letter of Recommendation for Roble MUMIN.
I worked with Roble from January 2018 till July 2022 in Tanzania.
He was working as Director of our two sister hotels
Oceanic Bay Hotel &amp; Resort in Bagamoyo/Tanzania
and
Mandhari Villa Hotel &amp; Resort in Matemwe/Zanzibar/Tanzania.
Above all he is my pillar in co-ordinating operations for our companies Salt City Limited, Oceanic Bay Limited, Mandhari Villa Matemwe Limited, Mchinga Bay Limited.
Roble is still holding the position and is acting as my counsellor and consultant for communication, IT, marketing and budget. The efficient way to lead his co-workers is evident for his highly developed goal-orientated leadership and a positive and constructive working atmosphere. Furthermore I appreciate his excellent communications and interpersonal skills as well as his problem-solving abilities. His suggestions are based on prior consideration of all possible situations and outcomes and this makes his solutions very successful.
